**Line 125:** Complex enhancement logic  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** Response enhancement involves multiple complex transformations in single methods.  
**Impact:** Enhancement logic is difficult to test and maintain.

**Line 200:** Hardcoded language replacements  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** Language simplification uses hardcoded word replacements without configuration.  
**Impact:** Cannot adapt language enhancement for different languages or contexts.

### src/infrastructure/ai/chatgpt/safety_filter.py

**Line 25:** Missing domain constants import  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** References constants from `src.domain.constants` that may not exist.  
**Impact:** Runtime errors when safety filter is used.

**Line 85:** Hardcoded safety patterns  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** Safety patterns and forbidden words are hardcoded without external configuration.  
**Impact:** Safety rules cannot be updated without code changes.

### src/infrastructure/cache/redis_cache.py

**Line 1:** Corrupted import structure  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** File starts with malformed docstring containing import statements.  
**Impact:** Cache functionality may be compromised.

**Line 85:** Missing connection pooling configuration  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** Redis connection lacks proper pooling and connection management.  
**Impact:** Performance issues and connection exhaustion under load.

### src/infrastructure/caching/redis_cache_manager.py

**Line 125:** Complex cache key management  
**Severity:** Major  
**Issue:** Cache key generation and management is scattered across multiple methods.  
**Impact:** Cache key consistency and management becomes difficult to maintain.

---

## MINOR ISSUES

### src/infrastructure/ai/models.py

**Line 15:** Minimal model definitions  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** AI response models lack comprehensive validation and metadata.  
**Impact:** Limited functionality for complex AI operations.

### src/infrastructure/ai/prompt_builder.py

**Line 25:** Simplistic prompt building  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** Prompt builder lacks advanced features like template inheritance and dynamic content.  
**Impact:** Limited flexibility for complex prompt scenarios.

### src/infrastructure/ai/safety_analyzer.py

**Line 35:** Placeholder implementation  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** Safety analyzer uses mock implementation instead of real AI moderation.  
**Impact:** Safety analysis is not effective for production use.

### src/infrastructure/caching/cache_config.py

**Line 25:** Hardcoded TTL values  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** Cache TTL values are hardcoded without environment-specific configuration.  
**Impact:** Cannot optimize cache behavior for different environments.

### src/infrastructure/chaos/actions/bias_detection_testing.py

**Line 85:** Limited bias test cases  
**Severity:** Minor  
**Issue:** Bias detection tests cover only basic scenarios without comprehensive edge cases.  
**Impact:** May miss subtle bias issues in AI responses.

**Most Critical Finding:** Multiple AI infrastructure files have corrupted import structures, making them unparseable. Additionally, the ChatGPT client lacks proper error handling and has hardcoded configurations.

**AI Infrastructure Issues:**
- Corrupted file structures preventing parsing
- Missing critical imports and dependencies
- Hardcoded model configurations without flexibility
- Incomplete error handling for API failures
- Missing dependency validation

**Chaos Testing Issues:**

3. Implement configuration system for model parameters
4. Resolve missing imports and dependency validation
5. Implement real safety analyzer instead of placeholder
6. Add proper Redis connection pooling
7. Make chaos testing endpoints configurable
8. Expand bias and hallucination test scenarios

**AI Service Impact:**
